Most programmers seem to enjoy logic problems as well as of course programming. But there is something better, writing a efficient program to either solve or create more of the same puzzles.

While working through some project Euler challenges, I programmed a backtracking algorithm in C++ to solve Sudoku problems [C++ solver][solver]. Well I wanted to use this code to create an app, so I created a HTML and CSS interface and solver and rewrite the code in JavaScript. The app can be download from [phonegap][phone-link], or to test it out in a browser at [sudoku-solver][play-link].
