Most programmers seem to enjoy logical problems as well as of course programming. But there is something better, writing an efficient program to either solve or create more of the same puzzles.

While working through some project Euler challenges, I programmed a backtracking algorithm in C++ to solve Sudoku problems [C++ solver][solver]. Well I wanted to use this code to create an app, so I created an HTML and CSS interface and solver and rewrote the code in JavaScript. The app can be downloaded from [phonegap][phone-link], or to test it out in a browser at [sudoku-solver][play-link].
