While creating the [Numbers Game], I envisioned creating a solver for the puzzle to support gameplay. One advantage of creating a solver was to avoid choosing a target that didn't have a perfect solution. 

It became clear that it was faster to compute the total by randomly selecting numbers the operators, rather than picking a number randomly and trying to solve it. 

I continued to create the Numbers Round Solver despite not requiring a solver for the actual game. It proved to be an interesting project, and a handy little app. [Try It Now][play-link].
