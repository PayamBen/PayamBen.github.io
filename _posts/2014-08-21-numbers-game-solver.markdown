While creating the Numbers Game, I hope to create a quick solver for puzzle to aid the gameplay. The idea was to avoid picking choosing a target that didn't have a perfect solution. It began clear that it's faster to compute the total by randomly choose the operators, than picking a number randomly and tring to solve it. Despite finding a better solution I continued creating the numbers round solver to create what I hope is a handy app. [Try It Now][play-link].
