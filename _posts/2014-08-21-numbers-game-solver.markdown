While creating the Numbers Game, I hoped to create a quick solver for puzzle to aid the gameplay. The idea was to avoid choosing a target that didn't have a perfect solution. It became clear that it's faster to compute the total by randomly choosing the operators, than picking a number randomly and trying to solve it. Despite finding a better solution I continued creating the Numbers Round Solver to create what I hope is a handy app. [Try It Now][play-link].
