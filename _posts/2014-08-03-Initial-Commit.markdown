Writing this post leads me to think Why use a github page at all? Basically because I wanted to experiement with Jekyll. I don't intent to update this blog regularly but this may well end up being a place I store odd bits of info just in case I need it in the future. However I blog regular about technology news, programming and at times securituy at techinfohound.com.
