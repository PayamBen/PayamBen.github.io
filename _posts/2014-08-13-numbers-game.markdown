In the UK there is a cult TV series called Countdown. The program test contestants using a varity of games but most notably the letters game and numbers game.

I created a fairly easy to use game based on the numbers game. The app once again is created in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, allowing the game converted into an app for most smart phones.

While creating the Numbers Game, I hope to create a quick solver for puzzle to aid the gameplay. The idea was to avoid picking choosing a target that didn't have a perfect solution. It began clear that it's faster to compute the total by randomly choose the operators, than picking a number randomly and tring to solve it. Despite finding a better solution I continued creating the numbers round solver to create what I hope is a handy app. [Try It Now][play-link].
